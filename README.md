## üìñ Overview

This project develops an **Automated Optical Inspection (AOI)** pipeline for **Printed Circuit Board (PCB)** defect detection. The system combines classical computer vision, deep learning, and CAD-driven alignment to deliver a reproducible, open-source solution for PCB quality control.

- **Phase 1 ‚Äì Board-Level Classification**  
  - Whole-board pass/fail classification using **ResNet18 (transfer learning)**.  
  - Tested on three Ploopy boards: **ADEPT**, **Trackpad**, and **Thumb R1**.  
  - Data augmentation: rotations, scaling, brightness/contrast jitter, pin-cushion distortion.  

- **Phase 2 ‚Äì Component-Level Detection**  
  - **Fiducial detection** + **homography alignment** with CAD files (DXF/STEP).  
  - Automatic cropping of component regions (demonstrated on **switches**).  
  - **YOLOv8** for real-time detection of *good_switch* vs *bad_switch*.
